She’s lived with the complicated global and local issues for decades and understands the nuance necessary to make good decisions. With the uncertain political and economic climate we need someone with a clear head and perspective.",
        "<b>She has the contacts:</b> Both within our government and globally, Clinton knows the players. She knows how they think. She’s shared memories and perspectives. International crisis in the Middle East – she knows who to call and how to talk to them. Bills that need to be passed in Washington? She's worked with them all.",
        "America needs a leader with experience, who’s learned the tough lessons, and knows how to apply restraint and perspective to our complicated times."

        "<b>Was it criminal:</b>  No. The FBI investigation concluded that they do not believe Clinton or her aids deliberately deleted or withheld emails. They also concluded that she did not intentionally or willfully mishandle classified information. Their extensive investigation concluded she acted recklessly but that there would be no charges. And they did not go easy on her or take this investigation lightly.",
        "<b>Did it cause any harm to our country?</b> No. There is no proof, formal charge, or specific allegation – only speculation – that foreign governments could have accessed her emails.",
        "<b>Does it mean we can’t trust her? Is this covering up something bigger?</b> Probably not. Any massive scandal she could be covering up in a deleted email would likely have come out elsewhere. Remember emails are two-way communications – they’re sent from someone to someone. Emails can be forwarded. If there were a huge scandal lurking in her correspondence it would be possible to trace it based on who it was sent to/from."

Recent labor stats show that almost 500,000 people are employed in finance in NYC. Wall Street contributes wealth to our nation and also contributes to financial problems. Our politicians NEED to talk to them",
