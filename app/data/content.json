        "Yes, Hillary is definitively a seasoned politician who has been at the center of politics for decades, which is exactly why she’s the best candidate for the job",
        "She’s got the experience:  As a former secretary of state, U.S. senator, and first lady, no one is more qualified to be president than Hillary. She’s lived with the complicated global and local issues for decades and understands the nuance necessary to make good decisions. With the uncertain political and economic climate we need someone with a clear head and perspective.",
        "She has the contacts: Both within our government and globally, Clinton knows the players. She knows how they think. She’s shared memories and perspectives. International crisis in the Middle East – she knows who to call and how to talk to them. Bills that need to be passed in Washington? She's worked with them all.",
        "America needs a leader with experience, who’s learned the tough lessons, and knows how to apply restraint and perspective to our complicated times."
